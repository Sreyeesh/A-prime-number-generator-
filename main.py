# In the last lecture we learned how to construct a generator function.
# Recall the code in an earlier lecture Two loop key words + finding prime numbers, where we learned how to find prime numbers:
# 1 for n in range(2,20):
# 2     for x in range(2, n):
# 3         if n % x == 0:
# 4             print('{} equals {} * {}.'.format(n, x, n//x))
# 5             break
# 6     else:
# 7         print('{} is a prime number.'.format(n))

# We used some nested for loops as well as for - else statements to determine primality of a number in a certain range (from 2  to 20  in the above code).
# In this exercise, we ask you to define a generator function which takes bound as input and generates prime numbers up to, but not including, the bound parameter.
# Happy coding!

"""
Take a look at the code in the problem description where we test if a number is prime.
Refactor the code and put it into the function below to turn the prime_generator() function into a generator.

Implement your generator so that others can get a prime number generator like this:

g = prime_generator(100)    # g can generate prime numbers under 100
next(g) # get next prime like this

Reminder: you don't need to change the function name nor the argument
